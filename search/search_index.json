Sub-catalogs are now fully supported! Catalogs can now contain other catalogs for unlimited nesting levels. This enables complex organizational hierarchies with multi-parent support for both catalogs and collections.</li> <li>01/09/2026: New Feature: Custom Index Mappings. You can now customize Elasticsearch/OpenSearch index mappings directly via environment variables without changing source code. Use <code>STAC_FASTAPI_ES_CUSTOM_MAPPINGS</code> to merge custom field definitions (e.g., for STAC extensions like SAR or Cube) or <code>STAC_FASTAPI_ES_MAPPINGS_FILE</code> to load mappings from a JSON file. See Custom Index Mappings for details.</li> <li>12/09/2025: Feature Merge: Multi-Tenant Catalogs. The <code>STAC API - Multi-Tenant Catalogs Endpoint Extension</code> is now in main! This enables a registry of catalogs and supports poly-hierarchy (collections belonging to multiple catalogs simultaneously). Enable it via <code>ENABLE_CATALOGS_EXTENSION</code>. Coming next: Support for nested sub-catalogs.</li> <li>11/07/2025: \ud83c\udf0d The SFEOS STAC Viewer is now available at: healy-hyperspatial.github.io/sfeos-web. Use this site to examine your data and test your STAC API!</li> <li>10/24/2025: Added <code>previous_token</code> pagination using Redis for efficient navigation. This feature allows users to navigate backwards through large result sets by storing pagination state in Redis. To use this feature, ensure Redis is configured (see Redis for navigation) and set <code>REDIS_ENABLE=true</code> in your environment.</li> <li>10/23/2025: The <code>EXCLUDED_FROM_QUERYABLES</code> environment variable was added to exclude fields from the <code>queryables</code> endpoint. See docs.</li> <li>10/15/2025: \ud83d\ude80 SFEOS Tools v0.1.0 Released! - The new <code>sfeos-tools</code> CLI is now available on PyPI</li> <li>10/15/2025: Added <code>reindex</code> command to SFEOS-tools for zero-downtime index updates when changing mappings or settings. The new <code>reindex</code> command makes it easy to apply mapping changes, update index settings, or migrate to new index structures without any service interruption, ensuring high availability of your STAC API during maintenance operations.</li> </ul> View Older News (Click to Expand)  ------------- - **10/12/2025:** Collections search **bbox** functionality added! The collections search extension now supports bbox queries. Collections will need to be updated via the API or with the new **[SFEOS-tools](https://github.com/Healy-Hyperspatial/sfeos-tools)** CLI package to support geospatial discoverability. \ud83d\ude4f Thanks again to **CloudFerro** for their sponsorship of this work! - **10/04/2025:** The **[CloudFerro](https://cloudferro.com/)** logo has been added to the sponsors and supporters list above. Their sponsorship of the ongoing collections search extension work has been invaluable. This is in addition to the many other important changes and updates their developers have added to the project. - **09/25/2025:** v6.5.0 adds a new GET/POST /collections-search endpoint (disabled by default via ENABLE_COLLECTIONS_SEARCH_ROUTE) to avoid conflicts with the Transactions Extension, and enhances collections search with structured filtering (CQL2 JSON/text), query, and datetime filtering. These changes make collection discovery more powerful and configurable while preserving compatibility with transaction-enabled deployments."},{"location":"#project-introduction-what-is-sfeos","title":"Project Introduction - What is SFEOS?","text":"<p>SFEOS (stac-fastapi-elasticsearch-opensearch) is a high-performance, scalable API implementation for serving SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog (STAC) data - an enhanced GeoJSON format designed specifically for geospatial assets like satellite imagery, aerial photography, and other Earth observation data.
